# Based on slides
Probable questions on the exam
Geometric interpretation of the weights/decision boundary
Delta vs perceptron rule
Backprop
Penalization of learning
N-fold crossvalidation
Competitative learning different strategies
Similarity neighborhood mapping - SOM
Preserving topographic mapping
No backprop through time calculation question
Reservoir computing the network is very simple establish the soup of reccurent state
Hopfield network
No GANS

# What the teacher specifically mentioned at the end of the lecture
Difference between the delta rule and perceptron learning, know how to calculate
What are the factors that affect generalization (complexity and amount data)
Regularization, early stopping, weight decay
High bias, Low variance
Hopfield network. Try a few patterns and see if they converge. Hopfield networks are symmetrical, so you can reverse pattern to obtain another stable point
RMBs, autoencoders, the principles of building stacked hiearchies.
Teacher will expand on question ten
More problem based questions
How to design a network for the problem at hand
No biological questions, practically
Topographical mapping, in essence the Self-Organizing map
Unsupervised learning algorithms (SOM, RBF, Autoencoers)
Supervised learnin algorithms (P, MLP)
